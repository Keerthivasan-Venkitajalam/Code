 # C Program to Find the Sum of 2 Numbers

This C program demonstrates two methods for finding the sum of two numbers: call by value and call by reference. It includes a detailed explanation of the code, making it easy for junior developers to understand.

## Call by Value

In call by value, a copy of the actual arguments is passed to the function. Any changes made to the formal parameters inside the function do not affect the actual arguments.

```c
int sumByVal(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In this function, `a` and `b` are copies of the actual arguments passed to the function. The function calculates the sum of these copies and returns the result.

## Call by Reference

In call by reference, the address of the actual arguments is passed to the function. Any changes made to the formal parameters inside the function directly affect the actual arguments.

```c
void sumByRef(int *a, int *b, int *sum) {
    *sum = *a + *b;
}
```

In this function, `a`, `b`, and `sum` are pointers that store the addresses of the actual arguments. The function calculates the sum of the values at these addresses and stores the result in the memory location pointed to by `sum`.

## Main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter two numbers, then calls the `sumByVal` and `sumByRef` functions to calculate the sum using call by value and call by reference, respectively.

```c
int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);

    sum = sumByVal(num1, num2);
    printf("Sum by value: %d\n", sum);

    sumByRef(&num1, &num2, &sum);
    printf("Sum by reference: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. The `main` function declares three integer variables: `num1`, `num2`, and `sum`.
2. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and stores them in `num1` and `num2`.
3. It calls the `
