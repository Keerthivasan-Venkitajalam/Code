General Instructions:

1. All the inputs in the test cases are valid. You don't need to check for the validity of the input.
2. The integers are in the range [1, 10^5].
3. Floating point values are to be printed with two decimal digits.
4. Refer the example program given for reading and writing data.
5. All scanf() format strings should end with "%*c". Not doing so can lead to issues when reading inputs containing strings and characters.
6. To read an entire line of input (including whitespace, but not the newline character) into a character array 'str', use the following statement:
   scanf("%[^\n]%*c", str);
7. DONOT use fflush() function, as it is not supported in LINUX platforms.
