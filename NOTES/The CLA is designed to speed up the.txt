The CLA is designed to speed up the addition operation by reducing the carry propagation delay¹⁴.

Here's a simplified explanation of how a 4-bit CLA works:

1. **Generate and Propagate Signals:** For each bit in the adder, calculate two intermediate signals: the "generate" signal \(G[i]\) and the "propagate" signal \(P[i]\). These are given by:
   - \(G[i] = A[i] \cdot B[i]\) (the AND of the two bits being added)
   - \(P[i] = A[i] \oplus B[i]\) (the XOR of the two bits being added)

2. **Carry Generation:** The carry signal for each bit is then calculated using these generate and propagate signals. The carry-out \(C[i]\) for each bit is given by:
   - \(C[0] = C_{in}\) (the initial carry-in)
   - \(C[1] = G[0] + P[0] \cdot C[0]\)
   - \(C[2] = G[1] + P[1] \cdot G[0] + P[1] \cdot P[0] \cdot C[0]\)
   - \(C[3] = G[2] + P[2] \cdot G[1] + P[2] \cdot P[1] \cdot G[0] + P[2] \cdot P[1] \cdot P[0] \cdot C[0]\)
   - \(C[4] = G[3] + P[3] \cdot G[2] + P[3] \cdot P[2] \cdot G[1] + P[3] \cdot P[2] \cdot P[1] \cdot G[0] + P[3] \cdot P[2] \cdot P[1] \cdot P[0] \cdot C[0]\)

3. **Sum Calculation:** Finally, the sum bits \(S[i]\) are calculated using the propagate signals and the carry signals:
   - \(S[i] = P[i] \oplus C[i]\)

This logic can be implemented using basic AND, OR, and XOR gates¹⁴. The advantage of a CLA is that it calculates the carry bits in advance based on the input signals, which reduces the time to calculate the result of the larger value bits³⁴.
